## Introduction


In Chapter \ref(chapter7) we worked with sampling. Specifically, the activities with red and white balls consisted on getting many random samples of the same size from a bowl, calculate the corresponding sample proportions of red balls from each of those samples, and studied what was the distribution of those sample proportions. We learned that

- the sampling distribution of the sampling proportion follows, approximately, the normal distribution, 
- the expected value of the sample proportion, located at the center of the distribution, is exactly equal to the population proportion, and
- the sampling variation, measured by the standard error of the sample proportion, is equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size used to collect the samples.

We also performed sampling with chocolate covered almonds where the statistic of interest was the sample mean weight. We learned that the characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion apply in exactly the same way to the sampling distribution of the sample mean; namely,

- the sampling distribution of the sampling mean follows, approximately, the normal distribution; 
- the expected value of the sample mean is the population mean, and
- the standard error of the sample mean is the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.

We ended the chapter showing that these characteristics also apply to sampling distributions for the difference of samples means, the difference of sample proportions, etc. Note that the sampling distribution is not dependent on the original distribution of the population values. As long as the samples taken are fairly large and we use the appropriate standard error, see \@ref(table-title), we can generalize these results appropriately.

On the other hand, you may remember that the original motivation was to determine population parameter values, such as the average weight of all the almonds in the entire bowl of almonds.

How can we determine the population mean weight of almonds in the bowl if we do not have access to the entire bowl? 
Based on the characteristics of the sampling distribution, stated above, if we have access to a large number of random samples and obtain the mean from each sample, we know that the average of those sample means will be a really good estimate of the expected value, which is precisely the population mean weight.

However, in real life situations, we do not have access to many random samples. In fact, we typically have access to a single random sample. How can we determine the population mean weight of almonds in the bowl if all we have is a single random sample of almonds? 

While we cannot determine exactly what the population mean weight of almonds is from any one random sample, we could __estimate__ the population mean based on our knowledge of this sample. 
The first idea would be to use the sample mean to estimate the population mean, but due to sampling variation we know that he sample mean is not equal to the population mean. Instead, we are going to build an interval based on the information from the sample and use this interval as an estimate of the population mean. 
This chapter discusses how to do this and why this is a clever idea that often produces useful results.

In Section \@ref(traditional_CI) we show how to use the sample mean observed and our knowledge of the sampling distribution of the sample mean to construct this interval. In Section \@ref(bootstrap_CI) we introduce a technique call the bootstrap that allows us to construct confidence intervals based on resampling from the original sample. In Section \@ref(compare_CI) we compare these two techniques and show advantage and disadvantage of using them. Finally, in Section \@ref(infer) we introduce syntax in R to perform bootstrap confidence intervals.

## Revisiting the Almond Activity for Estimation

In Chapter \@ref(chapter7) one of the activities was to take many random samples of size 100 from a bowl of chocolate covered almonds, get the sample means of these samples, construct a histogram using these sample means, and show how the histogram is a good approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. We redraw Figure \@ref(fig:sample-mean-100-with-normal) here as Figure \@ref(fig:sample-mean-100-with-normal-redraw), the histogram obtained using sample means from random samples of size $n=100$, and add a smooth curve for the normal distribution with appropriate expected value and standard error.

```{r sample-mean-100-with-normal-redraw, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.cap="The distribution of the sample mean.", purl=FALSE}
almonds_bowl <- read_rds("rds/almonds_bowl.rds")
n = 100
x = almonds_bowl$weight
mu = mean(x)
sigma = sqrt(mean(x^2)-mean(x)^2)
if (!file.exists("rds/virtual_mean_weight_100.rds")) {
  virtual_mean_weight_100 <- almonds_bowl |>
    rep_slice_sample(n = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) |>
    summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), n = n())
  write_rds(virtual_mean_weight_100, "rds/virtual_mean_weight_100.rds")
} else {
  virtual_mean_weight_100 <- read_rds("rds/virtual_mean_weight_100.rds")
}


ggplot(virtual_mean_weight_100, aes(x = mean_weight)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth = 0.018, color = "white") + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,  args = list(mean = mu, sd = sigma/sqrt(n)), col="red") + xlim(3.4,4) + ylim(0,12) +
  labs(
    x = "Sample means with n=100"
  )

```


As mentioned before, histograms, such as those seen in Figure \@ref(fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-3) provide a good approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, the distribution of $\bar X$. Since we are interested in the shape of the distribution, we redraw again the histogram obtained using sample proportions from random samples of size $n=25$, $n=50$, and $n=100$ but this time we add a smooth curve that appears to connect the top parts of each bar in the histogram. These histograms are presented in Figures \@ref(fig:sample-proportion-25-with-normal-pdf), \@ref(fig:sample-proportion-50-with-normal-pdf)







- Introducing the idea of estimation as the real goal. 
- Highlight sampling as a tool to understand estimation.
    - Introduce the idea of precision and accuracy
- Remark that in real-life examples one sample is all we get.



This chapter is about *estimation*. An estimate is a number obtained from a sample that represents some characteristic of the population. Recall that in Chapter \@ref(sampling), our original goal was to *estimate* the proportion of red balls in the bowl. Why did we learn about the sampling distribution of the sample proportion? Well, this knowledge will allow us to 




The concepts behind *sampling* form the basis for constructing confidence intervals and performing tests of significance also called hypothesis tests; these are the best-known and used inferential methods and are presented in Chapters \@ref(confidence-intervals) and \@ref(hypothesis-testing).

Later in Chapter \@ref(sampling) in a case study was presented 







Our study of the sampling distribution had the purpose of learning how it works 

Now that we learn 


We finished the chapter by presenting a case study in Section \@ref(sampling-case-study) when the  ["Gallup poll."](https://news.gallup.com/poll/471953/not-expect-return-pre-pandemic-normalcy.aspx) was presented. 

In this situation a *single* random sample and associated sample proportion was obtained. It is clear that we cannot build the sampling distribution with a single sample proportion, we need several of them to do this.

We also don't know if the sample obtained was 

We cannot and the sample proportion obtained from this sample is used as the *estimate* of the population proportion. 
This was the situation presented in 


Pollsters wanted to estimate the proportion of *all* people living in the US who believed that pre-pandemic normalcy was no longer attainable for them. 
They took a random sample of about 1000 people and determine that 47% of them believed that pre-pandemic normalcy was not attainable. 
This sample proportion is an *estimate* of the population proportion.

But, how can we know if this is a good estimate of the population proportion? Is it precise? Is it useful? As it turns out, we do not know exactly how precise this particular estimate is, but we know it comes from the sampling distribution of the sample proportion and in Chapter \@ref(sampling) we have learned important characteristics of this distribution. While the Gallup poll article did not provide additional information, oftentimes studies such as this provide a *margin of error* based on some level of confidence. As an illustration, a statement could have been: "We are 95% confident that the proportion of *all* people living in the US who believed that pre-pandemic normalcy was no longer attainable for them was 47% with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3%". Based on this information we could construct the interval [47% - 2.3%, 47% + 2.3%] = [44.7%, 49.3%]. This range of plausible values is called a *confidence interval* and provides an interval as an estimate of the sample proportion instead of a single value. This method, its construction, and its interpretation will be the central focus of this chapter.

In Section 8.1, we introduce another sampling activity, we sample chocolate-covered almonds from a bowl and determine the average weight of the sample. As we did earlier with the sample proportion, we use the average weight in the sample, or sample mean, as an estimate of the average weight of all the chocolate-covered almonds in the entire bowl, or population mean. We also show, using simulations, the properties of the sampling distribution for the sample mean. In section 8.2. we revisit the Central Limit Theorem, introduce the standard error for the sample mean, and show that the sample mean is a generalization of the sample proportion studied earlier. In Section 8.3. we discuss the real-life limitations of having a single sample and introduce bootstrapping, a resampling method that uses a single sample to approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean. In Section 8.4. we return to the central topic of using a sample mean (or sample proportion) to estimate the population mean (or population proportion). We formally introduce *confidence intervals*, provide their rationale and present two different methods to obtain them. The first one is called the *theory-based approach* and relies on large enough samples and the Central Limit Theorem. This method has been the central tool for statistical analysis for about two centuries. The second method is called the *simulation-based approach* and takes advantage of bootstrapping. In Section 8.5. we provide the details for the construction of confidence intervals under both approaches. In Section 8.6. we expand on the meaning and interpretation of confidence intervals and in Section 8.7. we conclude with a Case Study.

## Constructing confidence intervals {#bootstrap-process}

Recall that the process of resampling with replacement we performed by hand in Section \@ref(resampling-tactile) and virtually in Section \@ref(resampling-simulation) is known as \index{bootstrap!colloquial definition} *bootstrapping*. The term bootstrapping originates in the expression of "pulling oneself up by their bootstraps," meaning to ["succeed only by one's own efforts or abilities."](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pull_oneself_up_by_one%27s_bootstraps) 

From a statistical perspective, bootstrapping alludes to succeeding in being able to study the effects of sampling variation on estimates from the "effort" of a single sample. Or more precisely, \index{bootstrap!statistical reference} it refers to constructing an approximation to the sampling distribution using only one sample.

To perform this resampling with replacement virtually in Section \@ref(resampling-simulation), we used the `rep_sample_n()` function, making sure that the size of the resamples matched the original sample size of `r num_almonds`. In this section, we'll build off these ideas to construct confidence intervals using a new package: the `infer` package for "tidy" and transparent statistical inference. 


### Original workflow

Recall that in Section \@ref(resampling-simulation), we virtually performed bootstrap resampling with replacement to construct bootstrap distributions. Such distributions are approximations to the sampling distributions we saw in Chapter \@ref(sampling), but are constructed using only a single sample. Let's revisit the original workflow using the `%>%` pipe operator.

First, we used the `rep_sample_n()` function to resample ``size = `r num_almonds` `` almonds with replacement from the original sample of `r num_almonds` almonds in `almonds_sample` by setting `replace = TRUE`. Furthermore, we repeated this resampling `r n_virtual_resample` times by setting ``reps = `r n_virtual_resample` ``:

```{r eval=FALSE}
almonds_sample %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000)
```

Second, since for each of our `r n_virtual_resample` resamples of size `r num_almonds`, we wanted to compute a separate sample mean, we used the `dplyr` verb `group_by()` to group observations/rows together by the `replicate` variable...

```{r eval=FALSE}
almonds_sample %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) %>% 
  group_by(replicate) 
```

... followed by using `summarize()` to compute the sample `mean()` weight for each `replicate` group:

```{r eval=FALSE}
almonds_sample %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

For this simple case, we can get by with using the `rep_sample_n()` function and a couple of `dplyr` verbs to construct the bootstrap distribution. However, using only `dplyr` verbs only provides us with a limited set of tools. For more complicated situations, we'll need a little more firepower. Let's repeat this using the `infer` package.

### `infer` package workflow {#infer-workflow}

The `infer` package is an R package for statistical inference. It makes efficient use of the `%>%` pipe operator we introduced in Section \@ref(piping) to spell out the sequence of steps necessary to perform statistical inference in a "tidy" and transparent fashion.\index{operators!pipe} Furthermore, just as the `dplyr` package provides functions with verb-like names to perform data wrangling, the `infer` package provides functions with intuitive verb-like names to perform statistical inference.

Let's go back to our almonds. Previously, we computed the value of the sample mean $\overline{x}$ using the `dplyr` function `summarize()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
almonds_sample %>% 
  summarize(stat = mean(weight))
```

We'll see that we can also do this using `infer` functions `specify()` and `calculate()`: \index{infer!observed statistic shortcut}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
almonds_sample %>% 
  specify(response = weight) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

You might be asking yourself: "Isn't the `infer` code longer? Why would I use that code?". While not immediately apparent, you'll see that there are three chief benefits to the `infer` workflow as opposed to the `dplyr` workflow.

First, the `infer` verb names better align with the overall resampling framework you need to understand to construct confidence intervals and to conduct hypothesis tests (in Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing)). We'll see flowchart diagrams of this framework in the upcoming Figure \@ref(fig:infer-workflow-ci) and in Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing) with Figure \@ref(fig:htdowney).

Second, you can jump back and forth seamlessly between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing with minimal changes to your code. This will become apparent in Subsection \@ref(comparing-infer-workflows) when we'll compare the `infer` code for both of these inferential methods.

Third, the `infer` workflow is much simpler for conducting inference when you have *more than one variable*. We'll see two such situations. We'll first see situations of *two-sample* inference\index{two-sample inference} where the sample data is collected from two groups, such as in Section \@ref(case-study-two-prop-ci) where we study the contagiousness of yawning and in Section \@ref(ht-activity) where we compare promotion rates of two groups at banks in the 1970s. Then in Section \@ref(infer-regression), we'll see situations of *inference for regression* using the regression models you fit in Chapter \@ref(regression). 

Let's now illustrate the sequence of verbs necessary to construct a confidence interval for $\mu$, the population mean weight of minting of all US almonds in 2019.

#### 1. `specify` variables {-}

```{r infer-specify, out.width="20%", out.height="20%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram of the specify() verb.", purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flowcharts/infer/specify.png")
```

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:infer-specify), the `specify()` \index{infer!specify()} function is used to choose which variables in a data frame will be the focus of our statistical inference. We do this by `specify`ing the `response` argument. For example, in our `almonds_sample` data frame of the `r num_almonds` almonds sampled from the bank, the variable of interest is `weight`:

```{r}
almonds_sample %>% 
  specify(response = weight)
```

Notice how the data itself doesn't change, but the `Response: weight (numeric)` *meta-data* does\index{meta-data}. This is similar to how the `group_by()` verb from `dplyr` doesn't change the data, but only adds "grouping" meta-data, as we saw in Section \@ref(groupby).

We can also specify which variables will be the focus of our statistical inference using a `formula = y ~ x`. This is the same formula notation you saw in Chapters \@ref(regression) and \@ref(multiple-regression) on regression models: the response variable `y` is separated from the explanatory variable `x` by a `~` ("tilde"). The following use of `specify()` with the `formula` argument yields the same result seen previously:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
almonds_sample %>% 
  specify(formula = weight ~ NULL)
```

Since in the case of almonds we only have a response variable and no explanatory variable of interest, we set the `x` on the right-hand side of the `~` to be `NULL`. 

While in the case of the almonds either specification works just fine, we'll see examples later on where the `formula` specification is simpler. In particular, this comes up in the upcoming Section \@ref(case-study-two-prop-ci) on comparing two proportions and Section \@ref(infer-regression) on inference for regression.

#### 2. `generate` replicates {-}

```{r infer-generate, out.width="60%", out.height="60%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram of generate() replicates.", purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flowcharts/infer/generate.png")
```

After we `specify()` the variables of interest, we pipe the results into the `generate()` function to generate replicates. Figure \@ref(fig:infer-generate) shows how this is combined with `specify()` to start the pipeline. In other words, repeat the resampling process a large number of times. Recall in Sections \@ref(bootstrap-35-replicates) and \@ref(bootstrap-1000-replicates) we did this `r n_resample_friends` and `r n_virtual_resample` times.

The `generate()` \index{infer!generate()} function's first argument is `reps`, which sets the number of replicates we would like to generate. Since we want to resample the `r num_almonds` almonds in `almonds_sample` with replacement `r n_virtual_resample` times, we set ``reps = `r n_virtual_resample` ``. The second argument `type` determines the type of computer simulation we'd like to perform. We set this to `type = "bootstrap"` indicating that we want to perform bootstrap resampling. You'll see different options for `type` in Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
almonds_sample %>% 
  specify(response = weight) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("rds/almonds_sample_generate.rds")) {
  almonds_sample_generate <- almonds_sample %>%
    specify(response = weight) %>%
    generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap")
  write_rds(almonds_sample_generate, "rds/almonds_sample_generate.rds")
} else {
  almonds_sample_generate <- read_rds("rds/almonds_sample_generate.rds")
}
almonds_sample_generate
```

Observe that the resulting data frame has `r (num_almonds * n_virtual_resample) %>% comma()` rows. This is because we performed resampling of `r num_almonds` almonds with replacement `r n_virtual_resample` times and `r (num_almonds * n_virtual_resample) %>% comma()` = `r num_almonds` $\cdot$ `r n_virtual_resample`. 

The variable `replicate` indicates which resample each row belongs to. So it has the value `1` `r num_almonds` times, the value `2` `r num_almonds` times, all the way through to the value `` `r n_virtual_resample` `` `r num_almonds` times. The default value of the `type` argument is `"bootstrap"` in this scenario, so if the last line was written as ``generate(reps = `r n_virtual_resample`)``, we'd obtain the same results. 

**Comparing with original workflow**: Note that the steps of the `infer` workflow so far produce the same results as the original workflow using the `rep_sample_n()` function we saw earlier. In other words, the following two code chunks produce similar results:

```{r eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# infer workflow:                   # Original workflow:
almonds_sample %>%                  almonds_sample %>% 
  specify(response = weight) %>%        rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE, 
  generate(reps = 1000)                            reps = 1000)              
             
```

#### 3. `calculate` summary statistics {-}

```{r infer-calculate, out.width="80%", out.height="80%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram of calculate() summary statistics.", purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flowcharts/infer/calculate.png")
```

After we `generate()` many replicates of bootstrap resampling with replacement, we next want to summarize each of the `r n_virtual_resample` resamples of size `r num_almonds` to a single sample statistic value. As seen in the diagram, the `calculate()` \index{infer!calculate()} function does this.

In our case, we want to calculate the mean `weight` for each bootstrap resample of size `r num_almonds`. To do so, we set the `stat` argument to `"mean"`. You can also set the `stat` argument to a variety of other common summary statistics, like `"median"`, `"sum"`, `"sd"` (standard deviation), and `"prop"` (proportion). To see a list of all possible summary statistics you can use, type `?calculate` and read the help file.

Let's save the result in a data frame called `bootstrap_distribution` and explore its contents:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bootstrap_distribution <- almonds_sample %>% 
  specify(response = weight) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")
bootstrap_distribution
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("rds/bootstrap_distribution_almonds.rds")) {
  bootstrap_distribution <- almonds_sample %>%
    specify(response = weight) %>%
    generate(reps = 1000) %>%
    calculate(stat = "mean")
  write_rds(bootstrap_distribution, "rds/bootstrap_distribution_almonds.rds")
} else {
  bootstrap_distribution <- read_rds("rds/bootstrap_distribution_almonds.rds")
}
bootstrap_distribution
```

Observe that the resulting data frame has `r n_virtual_resample` rows and 2 columns corresponding to the `r n_virtual_resample` `replicate` values. It also has the mean weight for each bootstrap resample saved in the variable `stat`. 

**Comparing with original workflow**: You may have recognized at this point that the `calculate()` step in the `infer` workflow produces the same output as the `group_by() %>% summarize()` steps in the original workflow.

```{r eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# infer workflow:                   # Original workflow:
almonds_sample %>%                  almonds_sample %>% 
  specify(response = weight) %>%        rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE, 
  generate(reps = 1000) %>%                        reps = 1000) %>%              
  calculate(stat = "mean")            group_by(replicate) %>% 
                                      summarize(stat = mean(weight))
```

#### 4. `visualize` the results {-}

```{r infer-visualize, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram of visualize() results.", purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flowcharts/infer/visualize.png")
```

The `visualize()` \index{infer!visualize()} verb provides a quick way to visualize the bootstrap distribution as a histogram of the numerical `stat` variable's values. The pipeline of the main `infer` verbs used for exploring bootstrap distribution results is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:infer-visualize).  

```{r eval=FALSE}
visualize(bootstrap_distribution)
```

```{r boostrap-distribution-infer, echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Bootstrap distribution.", purl=FALSE}
# Will need to make a tweak to the {infer} package so that it doesn't always display "Null" here (added to `develop` branch on 2019-10-26)
visualize(bootstrap_distribution) #+
#  ggtitle("Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution")
```

**Comparing with original workflow**: In fact, `visualize()` is a *wrapper function* for the `ggplot()` function that uses a `geom_histogram()` layer. Recall that we illustrated the concept of a wrapper function in Figure \@ref(fig:moderndive-figure-wrapper) in Subsection \@ref(model1table).

```{r eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# infer workflow:                    # Original workflow:
visualize(bootstrap_distribution)    ggplot(bootstrap_distribution, 
                                            aes(x = stat)) +
                                       geom_histogram()
```

The `visualize()` function can take many other arguments which we'll see momentarily to customize the plot further. It also works with helper functions to do the shading of the histogram values corresponding to the confidence interval values.

Let's recap the steps of the `infer` workflow for constructing a bootstrap distribution and then visualizing it in Figure \@ref(fig:infer-workflow-ci).

```{r infer-workflow-ci, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="infer package workflow for confidence intervals.", purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flowcharts/infer/ci_diagram.png")
```

Recall how we introduced two different methods for constructing 95% confidence intervals for an unknown population parameter in Section \@ref(ci-build-up): the *percentile method* and the *standard error method*. Let's now check out the `infer` package code that explicitly constructs these. There are also some additional neat functions to visualize the resulting confidence intervals built-in to the `infer` package!


### Percentile method with `infer` {#percentile-method-infer}

Recall the percentile method for constructing 95% confidence intervals we introduced in Subsection \@ref(percentile-method). This method sets the lower endpoint of the confidence interval at the 2.5th percentile of the bootstrap distribution and similarly sets the upper endpoint at the 97.5th percentile. The resulting interval captures the middle 95% of the values of the sample mean in the bootstrap distribution.

We can compute the 95% confidence interval by piping `bootstrap_distribution` into the `get_confidence_interval()` \index{infer!get\_confidence\_interval()} function from the `infer` package, with the confidence `level` set to 0.95 and the confidence interval `type` to be `"percentile"`. Let's save the results in `percentile_ci`.

```{r}
percentile_ci <- bootstrap_distribution %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci
```

Alternatively, we can visualize the interval (`r percentile_ci[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(2)`, `r percentile_ci[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(2)`) by piping the `bootstrap_distribution` data frame into the `visualize()` function and adding a `shade_confidence_interval()` \index{infer!shade\_confidence\_interval()} layer. We set the `endpoints` argument to be `percentile_ci`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
visualize(bootstrap_distribution) + 
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci)
```

(ref:perc-ci-viz) Percentile method 95% confidence interval shaded corresponding to potential values.

```{r percentile-ci-viz, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:perc-ci-viz)", purl=FALSE, fig.height=3}
# Will need to make a tweak to the {infer} package so that it doesn't always display "Null" here (added to `develop` branch on 2019-10-26)
if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  visualize(bootstrap_distribution) +
    shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci) #+
  #  ggtitle("Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution")
} else {
  visualize(bootstrap_distribution) +
    shade_confidence_interval(
      endpoints = percentile_ci,
      fill = "grey40", color = "grey30"
    ) #+
  #  ggtitle("Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution")
}
```

Observe in Figure \@ref(fig:percentile-ci-viz) that 95% of the sample means stored in the `stat` variable in `bootstrap_distribution` fall between the two endpoints marked with the darker lines, with 2.5% of the sample means to the left of the shaded area and 2.5% of the sample means to the right. You also have the option to change the colors of the shading using the `color` and `fill` arguments. 

You can also use the shorter named function `shade_ci()` and the results will be the same. This is for folks who don't want to type out all of `confidence_interval` and prefer to type out `ci` instead. Try out the following code!

```{r eval=FALSE}
visualize(bootstrap_distribution) + 
  shade_ci(endpoints = percentile_ci, color = "hotpink", fill = "khaki")
```


### Standard error method with `infer` {#infer-se}

Recall the standard error method for constructing 95% confidence intervals we introduced in Subsection \@ref(se-method). For any distribution that is normally shaped, roughly 95% of the values lie within two standard deviations of the mean. In the case of the bootstrap distribution, the standard deviation has a special name: the _standard error_. 

So in our case, 95% of values of the bootstrap distribution will lie within $\pm `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)`$ standard errors of $\overline{x}$. Thus, a 95% confidence interval is 

$$\overline{x} \pm `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot SE = (\overline{x} - `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot SE, \, \overline{x} + `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot SE).$$

Computation of the 95% confidence interval can once again be done by piping the `bootstrap_distribution` data frame we created into the `get_confidence_interval()` function. However, this time we set the first `type` argument to be `"se"`. Second, we must specify the `point_estimate` argument in order to set the center of the confidence interval. We set this to be the sample mean of the original sample of `r num_almonds` almonds of `r x_bar_point <- x_bar %>% pull(mean_weight) %>% round(2); x_bar_point` we saved in `x_bar` earlier.

```{r}
standard_error_ci <- bootstrap_distribution %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(type = "se", point_estimate = x_bar)
standard_error_ci
```


If we would like to visualize the interval (`r standard_error_ci[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(2)`, `r standard_error_ci[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(2)`), we can once again pipe the `bootstrap_distribution` data frame into the `visualize()` function and add a `shade_confidence_interval()` layer to our plot. We set the `endpoints` argument to be `standard_error_ci`. The resulting standard-error method based on a 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:se-ci-viz).

(ref:se-viz) Standard-error-method 95% confidence interval.

```{r eval=FALSE}
visualize(bootstrap_distribution) + 
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = standard_error_ci)
```

```{r se-ci-viz, echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="(ref:se-viz)", purl=FALSE, fig.height=3.4}
# Will need to make a tweak to the {infer} package so that it doesn't always display "Null" here
# (added to `develop` branch on 2019-10-26)

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  visualize(bootstrap_distribution) +
    shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = standard_error_ci) #+
  #    ggtitle("Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution")
} else {
  visualize(bootstrap_distribution) +
    shade_confidence_interval(
      endpoints = standard_error_ci,
      fill = "grey40", color = "grey30"
    ) #+
  #    ggtitle("Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution")
}
```

As noted in Section \@ref(ci-build-up), both methods produce similar confidence intervals:

* Percentile method: (`r percentile_ci[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(2)`, `r percentile_ci[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(2)`)
* Standard error method: (`r standard_error_ci[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(2)`, `r standard_error_ci[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(2)`)

```

## Interpreting confidence intervals {#one-prop-ci}

Now that we've shown you how to construct confidence intervals using a sample drawn from a population, let's now focus on how to interpret their effectiveness. The effectiveness of a confidence interval is judged by whether or not it contains the true value of the population parameter. Going back to our fishing analogy in Section \@ref(ci-build-up), this is like asking, "Did our net capture the fish?".

So, for example, does our percentile-based confidence interval of (`r percentile_ci[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(2)`, `r percentile_ci[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(2)`) "capture" the true mean weight $\mu$ of *all* US almonds? Alas, we'll never know, because we don't know what the true value of $\mu$ is. After all, we're sampling to estimate it!

In order to interpret a confidence interval's effectiveness, we need to *know* what the value of the population parameter is. That way we can say whether or not a confidence interval "captured" this value. 

Let's revisit our sampling bowl from Chapter \@ref(sampling). What proportion of the bowl's `r nrow(bowl)` balls are red? Let's compute this:

```{r}
bowl %>% 
  summarize(p_red = mean(color == "red"))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
p_red <- bowl %>%
  summarize(prop_red = mean(color == "red")) %>%
  pull(prop_red)

# This code is used for dynamic non-static in-line text output purposes
n_friend_groups <- 33L
```

In this case, we *know* what the value of the population parameter is: we know that the population proportion $p$ is `r p_red`. In other words, we know that `r p_red*100`% of the bowl's balls are red. 

As we stated in Subsection \@ref(moral-of-the-story), the sampling bowl exercise doesn't really reflect how sampling is done in real life, but rather was an *idealized* activity. In real life, we won't know what the true value of the population parameter is, hence the need for estimation.

Let's now construct confidence intervals for $p$ using our `r n_friend_groups` groups of friends' samples from the bowl in Chapter \@ref(sampling). We'll then see if the confidence intervals "captured" the true value of $p$, which we know to be `r p_red * 100`%. That is to say, "Did the net capture the fish?".


### Did the net capture the fish? {#ilyas-yohan}

Recall that we had `r n_friend_groups` groups of friends each take samples of size `r n_balls_sample` from the bowl and then compute the sample proportion of red balls $\widehat{p}$. This resulted in `r n_friend_groups` such estimates of $p$. Let's focus on Ilyas and Yohan's sample, which is saved in the `bowl_sample_1` data frame in the `moderndive` package:

```{r}
bowl_sample_1
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This code is used for dynamic non-static in-line text output purposes
obs_red <- 21L
```

They observed `r obs_red` red balls out of `r n_balls_sample` and thus their sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ was `r obs_red`/`r n_balls_sample` = `r obs_red / n_balls_sample` = `r (obs_red / n_balls_sample) * 100`\%. Think of this as the "spear" from our fishing analogy. 

Let's now follow the `infer` package workflow from Subsection \@ref(infer-workflow) to create a percentile-method-based 95% confidence interval for $p$ using Ilyas and Yohan's sample. Think of this as the "net."

#### 1. `specify` variables {-}

First, we `specify()` the `response` variable of interest `color`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bowl_sample_1 %>% 
  specify(response = color)
```
```
Error: A level of the response variable `color` needs to be specified for the `success`
argument in `specify()`.
```

Whoops! We need to define which event is of interest! `red` or `white` balls? Since we are interested in the proportion red, let's set `success` to be `"red"`:

```{r}
bowl_sample_1 %>% 
  specify(response = color, success = "red")
```

#### 2. `generate` replicates {-}

Second, we `generate()` `r n_virtual_resample` replicates of *bootstrap resampling with replacement* from `bowl_sample_1` by setting ``reps = `r n_virtual_resample` `` and `type = "bootstrap"`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
bowl_sample_1 %>% 
  specify(response = color, success = "red") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap")
```
```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("rds/bowl_sample_1_generate.rds")) {
  bowl_sample_1_generate <- bowl_sample_1 %>%
    specify(response = color, success = "red") %>%
    generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap")
  write_rds(
    bowl_sample_1_generate,
    "rds/bowl_sample_1_generate.rds"
  )
} else {
  bowl_sample_1_generate <- read_rds("rds/bowl_sample_1_generate.rds")
}
bowl_sample_1_generate
```

Observe that the resulting data frame has `r (n_balls_sample * n_virtual_resample) %>% comma()` rows. This is because we performed resampling of `r n_balls_sample` balls with replacement `r n_virtual_resample` times and thus `r (n_balls_sample * n_virtual_resample) %>% comma()` = `r n_balls_sample` $\cdot$ `r n_virtual_resample`. The variable `replicate` indicates which resample each row belongs to. So it has the value `1` `r n_balls_sample` times, the value `2` `r n_balls_sample` times, all the way through to the value `` `r n_virtual_resample` `` `r n_balls_sample` times. 

#### 3. `calculate` summary statistics {-}

Third, we summarize each of the `r n_virtual_resample` resamples of size `r n_balls_sample` with the proportion of _successes_. In other words, the proportion of the balls that are `"red"`. We can set the summary statistic to be calculated as the proportion by setting the `stat` argument to be `"prop"`. Let's save the result as `sample_1_bootstrap`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sample_1_bootstrap <- bowl_sample_1 %>% 
  specify(response = color, success = "red") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")
sample_1_bootstrap
```

```{r calculate_prop, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# Note this takes a few minutes to run
if (!file.exists("rds/sample_1_bootstrap.rds")) {
  sample_1_bootstrap <- bowl_sample_1_generate %>%
    calculate(stat = "prop")
  write_rds(sample_1_bootstrap, "rds/sample_1_bootstrap.rds")
} else {
  sample_1_bootstrap <- read_rds("rds/sample_1_bootstrap.rds")
}
sample_1_bootstrap
```

Observe there are `r n_virtual_resample` rows in this data frame and thus `r n_virtual_resample` values of the variable `stat`. These `r n_virtual_resample` values of `stat` represent our `r n_virtual_resample` replicated values of the proportion, each based on a different resample.

#### 4. `visualize` the results {-}

Fourth and lastly, let's compute the resulting 95% confidence interval. 

```{r}
percentile_ci_1 <- sample_1_bootstrap %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci_1
```

Let's visualize the bootstrap distribution along with the `percentile_ci_1` percentile-based 95% confidence interval for $p$ in Figure \@ref(fig:shovel-bootstrap-1-infer). We'll adjust the number of bins to better see the resulting shape. Furthermore, we'll add a dashed vertical line at Ilyas and Yohan's observed $\widehat{p}$ = `r obs_red`/`r n_balls_sample` = `r obs_red/n_balls_sample` = `r (obs_red/n_balls_sample)*100`\% using `geom_vline()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
sample_1_bootstrap %>% 
  visualize(bins = 15) + 
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci_1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.42, linetype = "dashed")
```

```{r shovel-bootstrap-1-infer, echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Bootstrap distribution.", fig.height=2.5, purl=FALSE}
# Will need to make a tweak to the {infer} package so that it doesn't always display "Null" here
# (added to `develop` branch on 2019-10-26)
if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  sample_1_bootstrap %>%
    visualize(bins = 15) +
    shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci_1) +
    #    ggtitle("Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0.42, linetype = "dashed")
} else {
  sample_1_bootstrap %>%
    visualize(bins = 15) +
    shade_confidence_interval(
      endpoints = percentile_ci_1,
      fill = "grey40", color = "grey30"
    ) +
    #    ggtitle("Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0.42, linetype = "dashed")
}
```

Did Ilyas and Yohan's net capture the fish? Did their 95% confidence interval for $p$ based on their sample contain the true value of $p$ of `r p_red`? Yes! `r p_red` is between the endpoints of their confidence interval (`r percentile_ci_1[[1]]`, `r percentile_ci_1[[2]]`).

However, will *every* 95% confidence interval for $p$ capture this value? In other words, if we had a different sample of  50 balls and constructed a different confidence interval, would it necessarily contain $p$ = `r p_red` as well? Let's see!

Let's first take a different sample from the bowl, this time using the computer as we did in Chapter \@ref(sampling):

```{r}
bowl_sample_2 <- bowl %>% rep_sample_n(size = 50)
bowl_sample_2
```

Let's reapply the same `infer` functions on `bowl_sample_2` to generate a different 95% confidence interval for $p$. First, we create the new bootstrap distribution and save the results in `sample_2_bootstrap`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sample_2_bootstrap <- bowl_sample_2 %>% 
  specify(response = color, 
          success = "red") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, 
           type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")
sample_2_bootstrap
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("rds/sample_2_bootstrap.rds")) {
  sample_2_bootstrap <- bowl_sample_2 %>%
    specify(
      response = color,
      success = "red"
    ) %>%
    generate(
      reps = 1000,
      type = "bootstrap"
    ) %>%
    calculate(stat = "prop")
  write_rds(sample_2_bootstrap, "rds/sample_2_bootstrap.rds")
} else {
  sample_2_bootstrap <- read_rds("rds/sample_2_bootstrap.rds")
}
sample_2_bootstrap
```

We once again compute a percentile-based 95% confidence interval for $p$: 

```{r}
percentile_ci_2 <- sample_2_bootstrap %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci_2
```

Does this new net capture the fish? In other words, does the 95% confidence interval for $p$ based on the new sample contain the true value of $p$ of `r p_red`? Yes again! `r p_red` is between the endpoints of our confidence interval (`r percentile_ci_2[[1]]`, `r percentile_ci_2[[2]]`).

Let's now repeat this process 100 more times: we take 100 virtual samples from the bowl and construct 100 95% confidence intervals. Let's visualize the results in Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile) where:

1. We mark the true value of $p = `r p_red`$ with a vertical line.
1. We mark each of the 100 95% confidence intervals with horizontal lines. These are the "nets."
1. The horizontal line is colored grey if the confidence interval "captures" the true value of $p$ marked with the vertical line. The horizontal line is colored black otherwise.

(ref:reliable-perc) 100 percentile-based 95% confidence intervals for $p$.

    sample_data %>%

      generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
      calculate(stat = "prop")
  }

  # Compute nested data frame with sampled data, sample proportions, all
  # bootstrap replicates, and percentile_ci
  balls_percentile_cis <- bowl %>%
    rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 100, replace = FALSE) %>%

    nest() %>%

} else {
  balls_percentile_cis <- readRDS("rds/balls_percentile_cis.rds")
}

# Identify if confidence interval captured true p
percentile_cis <- balls_percentile_cis %>%
  unnest(percentile_ci) %>%
  mutate(captured = `2.5%` <= p_red & p_red <= `97.5%`)

# Plot them!
ggplot(percentile_cis) +
  geom_segment(aes(
    y = replicate, yend = replicate, x = `2.5%`, xend = `97.5%`,
    alpha = factor(captured, levels = c("TRUE", "FALSE"))
  )) +

  theme(

    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),

  )
```

Of the 100 95% confidence intervals, `r percentile_cis[["captured"]] %>% sum()` of them captured the true value $p = `r p_red`$, whereas `r 100 - percentile_cis[["captured"]] %>% sum()` of them didn't. In other words, `r percentile_cis[["captured"]] %>% sum()` of our nets caught the fish, whereas `r 100 - percentile_cis[["captured"]] %>% sum()` of our nets didn't. 

This is where the "95% confidence level" we defined in Section \@ref(ci-build-up) comes into play: for every 100 95% confidence intervals, we *expect* that 95 of them will capture $p$ and that five of them won't. 

Note that "expect" is a probabilistic statement referring to a long-run average. In other words, for every 100 confidence intervals, we will observe *about* 95 confidence intervals that capture $p$, but not necessarily exactly 95. In Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile) for example, `r percentile_cis[["captured"]] %>% sum()` of the confidence intervals capture $p$.

To further accentuate our point about confidence levels, let's generate a figure similar to Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile), but this time constructing 80% standard-error method based confidence intervals instead. Let's visualize the results in Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-se) with the scale on the x-axis being the same as in Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile) to make comparison easy. Furthermore, since all standard-error method confidence intervals for $p$ are centered at their respective point estimates $\widehat{p}$, we mark this value on each line with dots.  

(ref:rel-se) 100 SE-based 80% confidence intervals for $p$ with point estimate center marked with dots.

```{r reliable-se, fig.cap="(ref:rel-se)", echo=FALSE, fig.height=6.6, purl=FALSE}

  }

    ))

  # Save output to rds object
  saveRDS(object = balls_se_cis, "rds/balls_se_cis.rds")
} else {
  balls_se_cis <- readRDS("rds/balls_se_cis.rds")
}

# Identify if confidence interval captured true p
se_cis <- balls_se_cis %>%
  unnest(se_ci) %>%
  mutate(captured = lower <= p_red & p_red <= upper)

# Plot them!
ggplot(se_cis) +
  geom_segment(aes(
    y = replicate, yend = replicate, x = lower, xend = upper,

    aes(

    ),

  ) +
  labs(
    x = expression("Proportion of red balls"), y = "Confidence interval number",
    alpha = "Captured"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_red, color = "red") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.1, 0.7)) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()
  )
```

Observe how the 80% confidence intervals are narrower than the 95% confidence intervals, reflecting our lower degree of confidence. Think of this as using a smaller "net." We'll explore other determinants of confidence interval width in the upcoming Subsection \@ref(ci-width).

Furthermore, observe that of the 100 80% confidence intervals, `r se_cis[["captured"]] %>% sum()` of them captured the population proportion $p$ = `r p_red`, whereas `r 100 - sum(se_cis[["captured"]])` of them did not. Since we lowered the confidence level from 95% to 80%, we now have a much larger number of confidence intervals that failed to "catch the fish."


### Precise and shorthand interpretation {#shorthand}

\index{confidence interval!interpretation}

Let's return our attention to 95% confidence intervals. The precise and mathematically correct interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is a little long-winded:

> Precise interpretation: If we repeated our sampling procedure a large number of times, we expect about 95% of the resulting confidence intervals to capture the value of the population parameter. 

This is what we observed in Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile). Our confidence interval construction procedure is 95% _reliable_. That is to say, we can expect our confidence intervals to include the true population parameter about 95% of the time.

A common but incorrect interpretation is: "There is a 95% probability that the confidence interval contains $p$."  Looking at Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile), each of the confidence intervals either does or doesn't contain $p$. In other words, the probability is either a 1 or a 0. 

So if the 95% confidence level only relates to the reliability of the confidence interval construction procedure and not to a given confidence interval itself, what insight can be derived from a given confidence interval? For example, going back to the almonds example, we found that the percentile method 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ was (`r percentile_ci[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(2)`, `r percentile_ci[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(2)`), whereas the standard error method 95% confidence interval was (`r standard_error_ci[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(2)`, `r standard_error_ci[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(2)`). What can be said about these two intervals?

Loosely speaking, we can think of these intervals as our "best guess" of a plausible range of values for the mean weight $\mu$ of *all* US almonds. For the rest of this book, we'll use the following shorthand summary of the precise interpretation. 

> Short-hand interpretation: We are 95% "confident" that a 95% confidence interval captures the value of the population parameter. 

We use quotation marks around "confident" to emphasize that while 95% relates to the reliability of our confidence interval construction procedure, ultimately a constructed confidence interval is our best guess of an interval that contains the population parameter. In other words, it's our best net.

So returning to our almonds example and focusing on the percentile method, we are 95% "confident" that the true mean weight of almonds in circulation in 2019 is somewhere between `r percentile_ci[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(2)` and `r percentile_ci[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(2)`.


### Width of confidence intervals {#ci-width}

Now that we know how to interpret confidence intervals, let's go over some factors that determine their width.

#### Impact of confidence level {-}

One factor that determines confidence interval widths is the pre-specified confidence level. For example, in Figures \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile) and \@ref(fig:reliable-se), we compared the widths of 95% and 80% confidence intervals and observed that the 95% confidence intervals were wider. The quantification of the confidence level should match what many expect of the word "confident." In order to be more confident in our best guess of a range of values, we need to widen the range of values.

To elaborate on this, imagine we want to guess the forecasted high temperature in Seoul, South Korea on August 15th. Given Seoul's temperate climate with four distinct seasons, we could say somewhat confidently that the high temperature would be between 50&deg;F - 95&deg;F (10&deg;C - 35&deg;C). However, if we wanted a temperature range we were *absolutely* confident about, we would need to widen it. 

We need this wider range to allow for the possibility of anomalous weather, like a freak cold spell or an extreme heat wave. So a range of temperatures we could be near certain about would be between 32&deg;F - 110&deg;F (0&deg;C - 43&deg;C). On the other hand, if we could tolerate being a little less confident, we could narrow this range to between 70&deg;F - 85&deg;F (21&deg;C - 30&deg;C). 

Let's revisit our sampling bowl from Chapter \@ref(sampling). Let's compare $10 \cdot 3 = 30$ confidence intervals for $p$ based on three different confidence levels: 80%, 95%, and 99%. 

Specifically, we'll first take 30 different random samples of size $n$ = `r n_balls_sample` balls from the bowl. Then we'll construct 10 percentile-based confidence intervals using each of the three different confidence levels. 

Finally, we'll compare the widths of these intervals. We visualize the resulting confidence intervals in Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile-80-95-99) along with a vertical line marking the true value of $p$ = `r p_red`.

v2 TODO: Consider loading the perc_cis_by_level and percentile_cis_by_n data
frames into the moderndive package too so that readers can explore them a bit.
No need to include the code as well that generates them in the book.

However, making the code to replicate this process student-friendly is going to
take a lot of work and this chapter is getting rather large as is. For now, we
just show the resulting faceted plots comparing:

-For n=50, 80% + 95% + 99% confidence intervals
-For 95% confidence level, based on n = 25, 50, 100

<!--
v2 TODO: Consider including

Let's take a look into what the `perc_cis_by_level` data frame looks like and
how a sample of 10 different confidence intervals each from the 80%, 95%, and
99% levels compare visually in terms of length. Then, we'll start computing some
widths of the confidence intervals. Then we'll head into calculating the mean
and median widths across the three different levels.

```{r perc-cis-level-print, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
percentile_cis_by_level %>% 
  sample_n(10) %>% 
  kable(
    digits = 3,
    caption = "10 randomly sampled confidence intervals for p for varying confidence levels", 
    booktabs = TRUE,,
    linesep = ""
    longtable = TRUE
  ) %>%

                latex_options = c("hold_position", "repeat_header"))
```

We see that the sample proportion of reds varies in the `point_estimate` column with varying `lower` and `upper` bounds as well depending on the variability of the bootstrap distribution. The width of the confidence intervals appears to increase from left to right going from 80% confidence levels to 95% and then to 99%. Let's now compute the confidence interval (CI) width for each of these intervals and then get the median and mean length.
-->

  mutate(sample_row = 1:10)

  # Doesn't make sense to show point_estimate center for percentile confidence
  # intervals:
  # geom_point(aes(x = point_estimate, y = sample_row)) +

      strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey93")
    )
} else {

}
```

Observe that as the confidence level increases from 80% to 95% to 99%, the confidence intervals tend to get wider as seen in Table \@ref(tab:perc-cis-average-width) where we compare their average widths.

```{r perc-cis-average-width, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
percentile_cis_by_level %>%
  mutate(width = upper - lower) %>%
  group_by(confidence_level) %>%
  summarize(`Mean width` = mean(width)) %>%
  rename(`Confidence level` = confidence_level) %>%
  kable(
    digits = 3,
    caption = "Average width of 80, 95, and 99\\% confidence intervals",
    booktabs = TRUE,
    longtable = TRUE,
    linesep = ""
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "repeat_header")
  )
```

So in order to have a higher confidence level, our confidence intervals must be wider. Ideally, we would have both a high confidence level and narrow confidence intervals. However, we cannot have it both ways. If we want to _be more confident_, we need to allow for wider intervals. Conversely, if we would like a narrow interval, we must tolerate a lower confidence level. 

The moral of the story is: \index{confidence interval!impact of confidence level on interval width} **Higher confidence levels tend to produce wider confidence intervals.**  When looking at Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile-80-95-99) it is important to keep in mind that we kept the sample size fixed at $n$ = `r n_balls_sample`. Thus, all $10 \cdot 3 = 30$ random samples from the `bowl` had the same sample size. What happens if instead we took samples of different sizes? Recall that we did this in Subsection \@ref(sampling-simulation) using virtual shovels with 25, 50, and 100 slots. <!-- We delve into this next. -->

#### Impact of sample size {-}

This time, let's fix the confidence level at 95%, but consider three different sample sizes for $n$: 25, 50, and 100. Specifically, we'll first take 10 different random samples of size 25, 10 different random samples of size 50, and 10 different random samples of size 100. We'll then construct 95% percentile-based confidence intervals for each sample. Finally, we'll compare the widths of these intervals. We visualize the resulting 30 confidence intervals in Figure \@ref(fig:reliable-percentile-n-25-50-100). Note also the vertical line marking the true value of $p$ = `r p_red`.

Observe that as the confidence intervals are constructed from larger and larger sample sizes, they tend to get narrower. Let's compare the average widths in Table \@ref(tab:perc-cis-average-width-2).

    font_size = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),

  )
```

The moral of the story is: \index{confidence interval!impact of sample size on interval width} **Larger sample sizes tend to produce narrower confidence intervals.**   Recall that this was a key message in Subsection \@ref(moral-of-the-story). As we used larger and larger shovels for our samples, the sample proportions red $\widehat{p}$ tended to vary less. In other words, our estimates got more and more *precise*. 

Recall that we visualized these results in Figure \@ref(fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-31), where we compared the *sampling distributions* for $\widehat{p}$ based on samples of size $n$ equal 25, 50, and 100. We also quantified the sampling variation of these sampling distributions using their standard deviation, which has that special name: the *standard error*. So as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases. 

In fact, the standard error is another related factor in determining confidence interval width. We'll explore this fact in Subsection \@ref(theory-ci) when we discuss theory-based methods for constructing confidence intervals using mathematical formulas. Such methods are an alternative to the computer-based methods we've been using so far. 







## Theoretical Framework

### Why the simulation-based approach

Here comes the theory supporting the use of bootstrapping for inference
Some results based on simulations showing this (as hinted by Robert) would be useful here too

### Some details to take into account when using simulation-based confidence intervals

Best practices when using these methods
Introduce some theory/simulations/reference that show the bootstrap sample is an adequate method and could have some advantages over the theory-based approach


## Case study: Is yawning contagious? {#case-study-two-prop-ci}

Let's apply our knowledge of confidence intervals to answer the question: "Is yawning contagious?". If you see someone else yawn, are you more likely to yawn? In an episode of the US show [*Mythbusters*](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/yawning-contagious/), the hosts conducted an experiment to answer this question. The episode is available to view in the United States on the Discovery Network website [here](https://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/is-yawning-contagious) and more information about the episode is also available on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0768479/).

### *Mythbusters* study data

Fifty adult participants who thought they were being considered for an appearance on the show were interviewed by a show recruiter. In the interview, the recruiter either yawned or did not. Participants then sat by themselves in a large van and were asked to wait. While in the van, the *Mythbusters* team watched the participants using a hidden camera to see if they yawned. The data frame containing the results of their experiment is available in the `mythbusters_yawn` data frame included in the `moderndive` package: \index{moderndive!mythbusters\_yawn}

```{r}
mythbusters_yawn
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This code is used for dynamic non-static in-line text output purposes
n_participants <- 50L
```

The variables are:

- `subj`: The participant ID with values 1 through `r n_participants`.
- `group`: A binary *treatment* variable indicating whether the participant was exposed to yawning. `"seed"` indicates the participant was exposed to yawning while `"control"` indicates the participant was not. 
- `yawn`: A binary *response* variable indicating whether the participant ultimately yawned.

Recall that you learned about treatment and response variables in Subsection \@ref(correlation-is-not-causation) in our discussion on confounding variables. \index{variables!treatment}\index{variables!response}

Let's use some data wrangling to obtain counts of the four possible outcomes:

```{r}
mythbusters_yawn %>% 
  group_by(group, yawn) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
```

Let's first focus on the `"control"` group participants who were not exposed to yawning. 12 such participants did not yawn, while 4 such participants did. So out of the 16 people who were not exposed to yawning, 4/16 = 0.25 = 25% did yawn. 

Let's now focus on the `"seed"` group participants who were exposed to yawning where 24 such participants did not yawn, while 10 such participants did yawn. So out of the 34 people who were exposed to yawning, 10/34 = 0.294 = 29.4% did yawn. Comparing these two percentages, the participants who were exposed to yawning yawned 29.4% - 25% = 4.4% more often than those who were not.


### Sampling scenario

Let's review the terminology and notation related to sampling we studied in Subsection \@ref(terminology-and-notation). In Chapter \@ref(sampling) our *study population* was the bowl of $N$ = `r nrow(bowl)` balls. Our *population parameter* of interest was the *population proportion* of these balls that were red, denoted mathematically by $p$. In order to estimate $p$, we extracted a sample of 50 balls using the shovel and computed the relevant *point estimate*: the *sample proportion* that were red, denoted mathematically by $\widehat{p}$.

Who is the study population here? All humans? All the people who watch the show *Mythbusters*? It's hard to say! This question can only be answered if we know how the show's hosts recruited participants! In other words, what was the *sampling methodology*\index{sampling methodology} used by the *Mythbusters* to recruit participants? We alas are not provided with this information. Only for the purposes of this case study, however, we'll *assume* that the 50 participants are a representative sample of all Americans given the popularity of this show. Thus, we'll be assuming that any results of this experiment will generalize to all $N$ = 327 million Americans (2018 population). 

Just like with our sampling bowl, the population parameter here will involve proportions. However, in this case it will be the *difference in population proportions* $p_{seed} - p_{control}$, where $p_{seed}$ is the proportion of *all* Americans who if exposed to yawning will yawn themselves, and $p_{control}$ is the proportion of *all* Americans who if not exposed to yawning still yawn themselves. Correspondingly, the point estimate/sample statistic based the *Mythbusters*' sample of participants will be the *difference in sample proportions* $\widehat{p}_{seed} - \widehat{p}_{control}$. Let's extend Table \@ref(tab:table-ch8) of scenarios of sampling for inference to include our latest scenario. 

```{r table-ch8-c, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# The following Google Doc is published to CSV and loaded using read_csv():
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkOpnBGqOXGyJjwqx1T2O5G5D72wWGfWlPyufOgtkk4/edit#gid=0

if (!file.exists("rds/sampling_scenarios.rds")) {
  sampling_scenarios <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRd6bBgNwM3z-AJ7o4gZOiPAdPfbTp_V15HVHRmOH5Fc9w62yaG-fEKtjNUD2wOSa5IJkrDMaEBjRnA/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv" %>%
    read_csv(na = "") %>%
    slice(1:5)
  write_rds(sampling_scenarios, "rds/sampling_scenarios.rds")
} else {
  sampling_scenarios <- read_rds("rds/sampling_scenarios.rds")
}

sampling_scenarios %>%
  # Only first two scenarios
  filter(Scenario <= 3) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Scenarios of sampling for inference",
    booktabs = TRUE,
    escape = FALSE,
    linesep = ""
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position")
  ) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "0.5in") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "1.5in") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "0.65in") %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "1.6in") %>%
  column_spec(5, width = "0.65in")
```

This is known as a *two-sample* inference\index{two-sample inference} situation since we have two separate samples. Based on their two-samples of size $n_{seed}$ = 34 and $n_{control}$ = 16, the point estimate is

$$
\widehat{p}_{seed} - \widehat{p}_{control} = \frac{24}{34} - \frac{12}{16} = 0.04411765 \approx 4.4\%
$$

However, say the *Mythbusters* repeated this experiment. In other words, say they recruited 50 new participants and exposed 34 of them to yawning and 16 not. Would they obtain the exact same estimated difference of 4.4%? Probably not, again, because of *sampling variation*. 

How does this sampling variation affect their estimate of 4.4%? In other words, what would be a plausible range of values for this difference that accounts for this sampling variation? We can answer this question with confidence intervals! Furthermore, since the *Mythbusters* only have a single two-sample of 50 participants, they would have to construct a 95% confidence interval for $p_{seed} - p_{control}$ using *bootstrap resampling with replacement*.

We make a couple of important notes. First, for the comparison between the `"seed"` and `"control"` groups to make sense, however, both groups need to be *independent* from each other. Otherwise, they could influence each other's results. This means that a participant being selected for the `"seed"` or `"control"` group has no influence on another participant being assigned to one of the two groups. As an example, if there were a mother and her child as participants in the study, they wouldn't necessarily be in the same group. They would each be assigned randomly to one of the two groups of the explanatory variable.

Second, the order of the subtraction in the difference doesn't matter so long as you are consistent and tailor your interpretations accordingly. In other words, using a point estimate of $\widehat{p}_{seed} - \widehat{p}_{control}$ or $\widehat{p}_{control} - \widehat{p}_{seed}$ does not make a material difference, you just need to stay consistent and interpret your results accordingly. 


### Constructing the confidence interval {#ci-build}

As we did in Subsection \@ref(infer-workflow), let's first construct the bootstrap distribution for $\widehat{p}_{seed} - \widehat{p}_{control}$ and then use this to construct 95% confidence intervals for $p_{seed} - p_{control}$. We'll do this using the `infer` workflow again. However, since the difference in proportions is a new scenario for inference, we'll need to use some new arguments in the `infer` functions along the way.

#### 1. `specify` variables {-}

Let's take our `mythbusters_yawn` data frame and `specify()` which variables are of interest using the `y ~ x` formula interface where:

* Our response variable is `yawn`: whether or not a participant yawned. It has levels `"yes"` and `"no"`.
* The explanatory variable is `group`: whether or not a participant was exposed to yawning. It has levels `"seed"` (exposed to yawning) and `"control"` (not exposed to yawning).

```{r eval=FALSE}
mythbusters_yawn %>% 
  specify(formula = yawn ~ group)
```

```
Error: A level of the response variable `yawn` needs to be 
specified for the `success` argument in `specify()`.
```

Alas, we got an error message similar to the one from Subsection \@ref(ilyas-yohan): `infer` is telling us that one of the levels of the categorical variable `yawn` needs to be defined as the `success`. Recall that we define `success` to be the event of interest we are trying to count and compute proportions of. Are we interested in those participants who `"yes"` yawned or those who `"no"` didn't yawn? This isn't clear to R or someone just picking up the code and results for the first time, so we need to set the `success` argument to `"yes"` as follows to improve the transparency of the code:

```{r}
mythbusters_yawn %>% 
  specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = "yes")
```

#### 2. `generate` replicates {-}

Our next step is to perform *bootstrap resampling with replacement* like we did with the slips of paper in our almonds activity in Section \@ref(resampling-tactile). We saw how it works with both a single variable in computing bootstrap means in Section \@ref(bootstrap-process) and in computing bootstrap proportions in Section \@ref(one-prop-ci), but we haven't yet worked with bootstrapping involving multiple variables. 

In the `infer` package, bootstrapping with multiple variables means that each *row* is potentially resampled. Let's investigate this by focusing only on the first six rows of `mythbusters_yawn`:

```{r}
first_six_rows <- head(mythbusters_yawn)
first_six_rows
```

When we bootstrap this data, we are potentially pulling the subject's readings multiple times. Thus, we could see the entries of `"seed"` for `group` and `"no"` for `yawn` together in a new row in a bootstrap sample. This is further seen by exploring the `sample_n()` function in `dplyr` on this smaller 6-row data frame comprised of `head(mythbusters_yawn)`. The `sample_n()` function can perform this bootstrapping procedure and is similar to the `rep_sample_n()` function in `infer`, except that it is not repeated, but rather only performs one sample with or without replacement.

```{r}
first_six_rows %>% 
  sample_n(size = 6, replace = TRUE)
```

We can see that in this bootstrap sample generated from the first six rows of `mythbusters_yawn`, we have some rows repeated. The same is true when we perform the `generate()` step in `infer` as done in what follows. Using this fact, we `generate` `r n_virtual_resample` replicates, or, in other words, we bootstrap resample the `r n_participants` participants with replacement `r n_virtual_resample` times. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
mythbusters_yawn %>% 
  specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = "yes") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("rds/generate_yawn.rds")) {
  generate_yawn <- mythbusters_yawn %>%
    specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = "yes") %>%
    generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap")
  write_rds(generate_yawn, "rds/generate_yawn.rds")
} else {
  generate_yawn <- read_rds("rds/generate_yawn.rds")
}
generate_yawn
```

Observe that the resulting data frame has `r (n_virtual_resample * n_participants) %>% comma()` rows. This is because we performed resampling of `r n_participants` participants with replacement `r n_virtual_resample` times and `r (n_virtual_resample * n_participants) %>% comma()` = `r n_virtual_resample` $\cdot$ `r n_participants`. The variable `replicate` indicates which resample each row belongs to. So it has the value `1` `r n_participants` times, the value `2` `r n_participants` times, all the way through to the value `` `r n_virtual_resample` `` `r n_participants` times. 

#### 3. `calculate` summary statistics {-}

After we `generate()` many replicates of bootstrap resampling with replacement, we next want to summarize the bootstrap resamples of size `r n_participants` with a single summary statistic, the difference in proportions. We do this by setting the `stat` argument to `"diff in props"`:

<!-- 
Chester: A challenging Learning check for those {dplyr} diehards is to get these values 
without using {infer}. It takes a double group_by() and some trickery, but could 
be a good exercise for those that don't quite see the power of {infer}.

Albert: Great idea!
-->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mythbusters_yawn %>% 
  specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = "yes") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props")
```
```
Error: Statistic is based on a difference; specify the `order` in which to
subtract the levels of the explanatory variable.
```

We see another error here. We need to specify the order of the subtraction. Is it $\widehat{p}_{seed} - \widehat{p}_{control}$ or $\widehat{p}_{control} - \widehat{p}_{seed}$. We specify it to be $\widehat{p}_{seed} - \widehat{p}_{control}$ by setting `order = c("seed", "control")`.  Note that you could've also set `order = c("control", "seed")`. As we stated earlier, the order of the subtraction does not matter, so long as you stay consistent throughout your analysis and tailor your interpretations accordingly. 

Let's save the output in a data frame `bootstrap_distribution_yawning`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bootstrap_distribution_yawning <- mythbusters_yawn %>% 
  specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = "yes") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("seed", "control"))
bootstrap_distribution_yawning
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("rds/bootstrap_distribution_yawning.rds")) {
  bootstrap_distribution_yawning <- mythbusters_yawn %>%
    specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = "yes") %>%
    generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
    calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("seed", "control"))
  write_rds(
    bootstrap_distribution_yawning,
    "rds/bootstrap_distribution_yawning.rds"
  )
} else {
  bootstrap_distribution_yawning <- read_rds(
    "rds/bootstrap_distribution_yawning.rds"
  )
}
bootstrap_distribution_yawning
```

Observe that the resulting data frame has `r n_virtual_resample` rows and 2 columns corresponding to the `r n_virtual_resample` `replicate` ID's and the `r n_virtual_resample` differences in proportions for each bootstrap resample in `stat`.

#### 4. `visualize` the results {-}

In Figure \@ref(fig:bootstrap-distribution-mythbusters) we `visualize()` the resulting bootstrap resampling distribution. Let's also add a vertical line at 0 by adding a `geom_vline()` layer. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
visualize(bootstrap_distribution_yawning) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)
```
```{r bootstrap-distribution-mythbusters, echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Bootstrap distribution.", purl=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
# Will need to make a tweak to the {infer} package so that it doesn't always display "Null" here (added to `develop` branch on 2019-10-26)
visualize(bootstrap_distribution_yawning) +
  #  ggtitle("Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)
```

First, let's compute the 95% confidence interval for $p_{seed} - p_{control}$ using the percentile method, in other words, by identifying the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles which include the middle 95% of values. Recall that this method does not require the bootstrap distribution to be normally shaped. 

```{r}
bootstrap_distribution_yawning %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(type = "percentile", level = 0.95)
```
```{r include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
myth_ci_percentile <- bootstrap_distribution_yawning %>%
  get_confidence_interval(type = "percentile", level = 0.95)
```

Second, since the bootstrap distribution is roughly bell-shaped, we can construct a confidence interval using the standard error method as well. Recall that to construct a confidence interval using the standard error method, we need to specify the center of the interval using the `point_estimate` argument. In our case, we need to set it to be the difference in sample proportions of 4.4% that the *Mythbusters* observed.

We can also use the `infer` workflow to compute this value by excluding the `generate()` `r n_virtual_resample` bootstrap replicates step. In other words, do not generate replicates, but rather use only the original sample data. We can achieve this by commenting out the `generate()` line, telling R to ignore it:

```{r}
obs_diff_in_props <- mythbusters_yawn %>% 
  specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = "yes") %>% 
  # generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("seed", "control"))
obs_diff_in_props
```

We thus plug this value in as the `point_estimate` argument. 

```{r}
myth_ci_se <- bootstrap_distribution_yawning %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(type = "se", point_estimate = obs_diff_in_props)
myth_ci_se
```

Let's visualize both confidence intervals in Figure \@ref(fig:bootstrap-distribution-mythbusters-CI), with the percentile-method interval marked with black lines and the standard-error-method marked with grey lines. Observe that they are both similar to each other. 

```{r bootstrap-distribution-mythbusters-CI, echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Two 95\\% confidence intervals: percentile method (black) and standard error method (grey).", purl=FALSE}
# Will need to make a tweak to the {infer} package so that it doesn't always display "Null" here (added to `develop` branch on 2019-10-26)
visualize(bootstrap_distribution_yawning) +
  ggtitle("") +
  shade_confidence_interval(
    endpoints = myth_ci_percentile, fill = NULL,
    color = "black"
  ) +
  shade_confidence_interval(
    endpoints = myth_ci_se, fill = NULL,
    color = "grey70"
  )
```


### Interpreting the confidence interval

Given that both confidence intervals are quite similar, let's focus our interpretation to only the percentile-method confidence interval of (`r myth_ci_percentile[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(4)`, `r myth_ci_percentile[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(4)`). Recall from Subsection \@ref(shorthand) that the precise statistical interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is: if this construction procedure is repeated 100 times, then we expect about 95 of the confidence intervals to capture the true value of $p_{seed} - p_{control}$. In other words, if we gathered 100 samples of $n$ = `r n_participants` participants from a similar pool of people and constructed 100 confidence intervals each based on each of the 100 samples, about 95 of them will contain the true value of $p_{seed} - p_{control}$ while about five won't. Given that this is a little long winded, we use the shorthand interpretation: we're 95% "confident" that the true difference in proportions $p_{seed} - p_{control}$ is between (`r myth_ci_percentile[["lower_ci"]] %>% round(4)`, `r myth_ci_percentile[["upper_ci"]] %>% round(4)`).

There is one value of particular interest that this 95% confidence interval contains: zero. If $p_{seed} - p_{control}$ were equal to 0, then there would be no difference in proportion yawning between the two groups. This would suggest that there is no associated effect of being exposed to a yawning recruiter on whether you yawn yourself. 

In our case, since the 95% confidence interval includes 0, we cannot conclusively say if either proportion is larger. Of our `r n_virtual_resample` bootstrap resamples with replacement, sometimes $\widehat{p}_{seed}$ was higher and thus those exposed to yawning yawned themselves more often. At other times, the reverse happened. 

Say, on the other hand, the 95% confidence interval was entirely above zero. This would suggest that $p_{seed} - p_{control} > 0$, or, in other words $p_{seed} > p_{control}$, and thus we'd have evidence suggesting those exposed to yawning do yawn more often. 

<!--
v2 TODO: Talk about randomized experiment nature of Mythbusters data

Add this back once we add a discussion on random assignment and 
randomized experiments in Conclusion of sampling chapter

Furthermore, if the `r n_participants` participants were randomly allocated to
the `"seed"` and `"control"` groups, then this would be suggestive that being
exposed to yawning doesn't not *cause* yawning. In other words, yawning is not
contagious. However, no information on how participants were assigned to be
exposed to yawning or not could be found, so we cannot make such a causal
statement.
-->






## Summary and Final Remarks


## Conclusion {#ci-conclusion}

### Comparing bootstrap and sampling distributions {#bootstrap-vs-sampling}

Let's talk more about the relationship between *sampling distributions* and *bootstrap distributions*.\index{bootstrap!distribution}\index{sampling distributions}

Recall back in Subsection \@ref(sampling-simulation), we took `r n_virtual_resample` virtual samples from the `bowl` using a virtual shovel, computed `r n_virtual_resample` values of the sample proportion red $\widehat{p}$, then visualized their distribution in a histogram. Recall that this distribution is called the *sampling distribution of* $\widehat{p}$. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution has a special name: the *standard error*.

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This code is used for dynamic non-static in-line text output purposes
p_obama <- 0.41
moe_obama <- 0.021
```


We also mentioned that this sampling activity does not reflect how sampling is done in real life. Rather, it was an *idealized version* of sampling so that we could study the effects of sampling variation on estimates, like the proportion of the shovel's balls that are red. In real life, however, one would take a single sample that's as large as possible, much like in the Obama poll we saw in Section \@ref(sampling-case-study). But how can we get a sense of the effect of sampling variation on estimates if we only have one sample and thus only one estimate? Don't we need many samples and hence many estimates?

The workaround to having a *single* sample was to perform *bootstrap resampling with replacement* from the single sample. We did this in the resampling activity in Section \@ref(resampling-tactile) where we focused on the mean weight of minting of almonds. We used pieces of paper representing the original sample of `r num_almonds` almonds from the bank and resampled them with replacement from a hat. We had `r n_resample_friends` of our friends perform this activity and visualized the resulting `r n_resample_friends` sample means $\overline{x}$ in a histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:tactile-resampling-6). 

This distribution was called the *bootstrap distribution* of $\overline{x}$. We stated at the time that the bootstrap distribution is an *approximation* to the sampling distribution of $\overline{x}$ in the sense that both distributions will have a similar shape and similar spread. \index{bootstrap!distribution!approximation of sampling distribution} Thus the *standard error* of the bootstrap distribution can be used as an approximation to the *standard error* of the sampling distribution. 

Let's show you that this is the case by now comparing these two types of distributions. Specifically, we'll compare

1. the sampling distribution of $\widehat{p}$ based on `r n_virtual_resample` virtual samples from the `bowl` from Subsection \@ref(sampling-simulation) to
1. the bootstrap distribution of $\widehat{p}$ based on `r n_virtual_resample` virtual resamples with replacement from Ilyas and Yohan's single sample `bowl_sample_1` from Subsection \@ref(ilyas-yohan).


#### Sampling distribution {-}

Here is the code you saw in Subsection \@ref(sampling-simulation) to construct the sampling distribution of $\widehat{p}$ shown again in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-distribution-part-deux), with some changes to incorporate the statistical terminology relating to sampling from Subsection \@ref(terminology-and-notation).

```{r,echo=FALSE}
set.seed(76)
```

```{r sampling-distribution-part-deux, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Previously seen sampling distribution of sample proportion red for $n = 1000$.", fig.height=2}
# Take 1000 virtual samples of size 50 from the bowl:
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000)
# Compute the sampling distribution of 1000 values of p-hat
sampling_distribution <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)
# Visualize sampling distribution of p-hat
ggplot(sampling_distribution, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
       title = "Sampling distribution")
```

An important thing to keep in mind is the default value for `replace` is `FALSE` when using `rep_sample_n()`. This is because when sampling `r n_balls_sample` balls with a shovel, we are extracting `r n_balls_sample` balls one-by-one *without* replacing them. This is in contrast to bootstrap resampling *with* replacement, where we resample a ball and put it back, and repeat this process `r n_balls_sample` times. 

Let's quantify the variability in this sampling distribution by calculating the standard deviation of the `prop_red` variable representing `r n_virtual_resample` values of the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$. Remember that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the *standard error*, frequently denoted as `se`.

```{r}
sampling_distribution %>% summarize(se = sd(prop_red))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
se_samp <- sampling_distribution %>%
  summarize(se = sd(prop_red)) %>%
  pull(se)
```

#### Bootstrap distribution {-}

Here is the code you previously saw in Subsection \@ref(ilyas-yohan) to construct the bootstrap distribution of $\widehat{p}$ based on Ilyas and Yohan's original sample of `r n_balls_sample` balls saved in `bowl_sample_1`.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
set.seed(76)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
bootstrap_distribution <- bowl_sample_1 %>% 
  specify(response = color, success = "red") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("rds/bootstrap_distribution_balls.rds")) {
  bootstrap_distribution <- bowl_sample_1 %>%
    specify(response = color, success = "red") %>%
    generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
    calculate(stat = "prop")
  write_rds(
    bootstrap_distribution,
    "rds/bootstrap_distribution_balls.rds"
  )
} else {
  bootstrap_distribution <- read_rds("rds/bootstrap_distribution_balls.rds")
}
```

```{r bootstrap-distribution-part-deux, echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Bootstrap distribution of proportion red for $n = 1000$.", purl=FALSE, fig.height=2.5}
# Visualize bootstrap distribution of p-hat
bootstrap_distribution %>%
  visualize(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(
    x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red",
    title = "Bootstrap distribution"
  )
```

```{r}
bootstrap_distribution %>% summarize(se = sd(stat))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
se_boot <- bootstrap_distribution %>%
  summarize(se = sd(stat)) %>%
  pull(se)
```

#### Comparison {-}

Now that we have computed both the sampling distribution and the bootstrap distributions, let's compare them side-by-side in Figure \@ref(fig:side-by-side). We'll make both histograms have matching scales on the x- and y-axes to make them more comparable. Furthermore, we'll add:

1. To the sampling distribution on the top: a solid line denoting the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red $p$ = `r p_red`. 
1. To the bootstrap distribution on the bottom: a dashed line at the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ = `r obs_red`/`r n_balls_sample` = `r obs_red/n_balls_sample` = `r (obs_red/n_balls_sample)*100`\% that Ilyas and Yohan observed.

```{r side-by-side, fig.height=4.5, fig.cap="Comparing the sampling and bootstrap distributions of $\\widehat{p}$.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
p_samp <- ggplot(sampling_distribution, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, fill = "salmon",
    color = "white"
  ) +
  labs(x = "", title = "Sampling distribution") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_red, size = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(0.15, 0.65),
    breaks = seq(from = 0.15, to = 0.65, by = 0.1)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 350),
    breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 400, by = 100)
  )
p_boot <- ggplot(bootstrap_distribution, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, fill = "blue",
    color = "white"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red",
    title =
      "Bootstrap distribution: similar shape and spread but different center"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.42, size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(0.15, 0.65),
    breaks = seq(from = 0.15, to = 0.65, by = 0.1)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 350), breaks = seq(
    from = 0,
    to = 400, by = 100
  ))
p_samp + p_boot + plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(1, 1))
```

There is a lot going on in Figure \@ref(fig:side-by-side), so let's break down all the comparisons slowly. First, observe how the sampling distribution on top is centered at $p$ = `r p_red`. This is because the sampling is done at random and in an unbiased fashion. So the estimates $\widehat{p}$ are centered at the true value of $p$. 

However, this is not the case with the following bootstrap distribution. The bootstrap distribution is centered at 0.42, which is the proportion red of Ilyas and Yohan's `r n_balls_sample` sampled balls. This is because we are resampling from the same sample over and over again. Since the bootstrap distribution is centered at the original sample's proportion, it doesn't necessarily provide a better estimate of $p$ = `r p_red`. This leads us to our first lesson about bootstrapping:

> The bootstrap distribution will likely not have the same center as the sampling distribution. In other words, bootstrapping cannot improve the quality of an estimate.

Second, let's now compare the spread of the two distributions: they are somewhat similar. In the previous code, we computed the standard deviations of both distributions as well. Recall that such standard deviations have a special name: *standard errors*. Let's compare them in Table \@ref(tab:comparing-se).

```{r comparing-se, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
tibble(
  `Distribution type` = c("Sampling distribution", "Bootstrap distribution"),
  `Standard error` = c(se_samp, se_boot)
) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Comparing standard errors",
    digits = 3,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    escape = FALSE,
    linesep = ""
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "repeat_header")
  )
```

Notice that the bootstrap distribution's standard error is a rather good *approximation* to the sampling distribution's standard error. This leads us to our second lesson about bootstrapping:

> Even if the bootstrap distribution might not have the same center as the sampling distribution, it will likely have very similar shape and spread. In other words, bootstrapping will give you a good estimate of the *standard error*. 

Thus, using the fact that the bootstrap distribution and sampling distributions have similar spreads, we can build confidence intervals using bootstrapping as we've done all throughout this chapter!


### Theory-based confidence intervals {#theory-ci}

So far in this chapter, we've constructed confidence intervals using two methods: the percentile method and the standard error method. Recall also from Subsection \@ref(se-method) that we can only use the standard-error method if the bootstrap distribution is bell-shaped (i.e., normally distributed). 

In a similar vein, if the sampling distribution is normally shaped, there is another method for constructing confidence intervals that does not involve using your computer. You can use a *theory-based method* involving mathematical formulas!

The formula uses the rule of thumb we saw in Appendix \@ref(appendix-normal-curve) that 95% of values in a normal distribution are within $\pm `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)`$ standard deviations of the mean. In the case of sampling and bootstrap distributions, remember that the standard deviation has a special name: the *standard error*. Recall further in Subsection \@ref(theory-se) you saw that there is a theory-based formula to approximate the standard error for sample proportions $\widehat{p}$:

$$\text{SE}_{\widehat{p}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$$

If you've forgotten this fact and what it says about the relationship between "precision" of your estimates and your sample size $n$, we highly recommend you re-read Subsection \@ref(theory-se).

Recall from `bowl_sample_1` that Yohan and Ilyas sampled $n = 50$ balls and observed a sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ of `r obs_red`/`r n_balls_sample` = `r obs_red/n_balls_sample`. An approximation of the standard error of $\widehat{p}$ based on Yohan and Ilyas' sample is thus:

$$\text{SE}_{\widehat{p}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.42(1-0.42)}{50}} = \sqrt{0.004872} = 0.0698 \approx 0.070$$

Let's compare this theory-based standard error to the standard error of the sampling and bootstrap distributions you computed previously in Subsection \@ref(bootstrap-vs-sampling) in Table \@ref(tab:comparing-se-2). Notice how they are all similar!

```{r comparing-se-2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
tibble(
  `Distribution type` = c(
    "Sampling distribution", "Bootstrap distribution",
    "Formula approximation"
  ),
  `Standard error` = c(se_samp, se_boot, 0.0698)
) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Comparing standard errors",
    digits = 3,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    escape = FALSE,
    linesep = ""
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "repeat_header")
  )
```

Using the theory-based standard error, let's present a theory-based method for constructing 95% confidence intervals that does not involve using a computer, but rather mathematical formulas. Note that this theory-based method only holds if the sampling distribution is normally shaped, so that we can use the 95% rule of thumb about normal distributions discussed in Appendix \@ref(appendix-normal-curve).

1. Collect a single representative sample of size $n$ that's as large as possible.
2. Compute the *point estimate*: the *sample proportion* $\widehat{p}$. Think of this as the center of your "net."
3. Compute the approximation to the standard error 

$$\text{SE}_{\widehat{p}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$$

4. Compute a quantity known as the *margin of error* (more on this later after we list the five steps):

$$\text{MoE}_{\widehat{p}} = `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \text{SE}_{\widehat{p}} =  `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$$

5. Compute both endpoints of the confidence interval. 
    + The lower end-point. Think of this as the left end-point of the net: 
    $$\widehat{p} - \text{MoE}_{\widehat{p}} = \widehat{p} - `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \text{SE}_{\widehat{p}} = \widehat{p} - `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$$
    
    + The upper endpoint. Think of this as the right end-point of the net: 
    $$\widehat{p} + \text{MoE}_{\widehat{p}} = \widehat{p} + `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \text{SE}_{\widehat{p}} = \widehat{p} + `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$$
    
    + Alternatively, you can succinctly summarize a 95% confidence interval for $p$ using the $\pm$ symbol: 
    
    $$\widehat{p} \pm \text{MoE}_{\widehat{p}} = \widehat{p} \pm (`r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \text{SE}_{\widehat{p}}) = \widehat{p} \pm \left( `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}} \right)$$

So going back to Yohan and Ilyas' sample of $n = `r n_balls_sample`$ balls that had `r obs_red` red balls, the 95% confidence interval for $p$ is 

$$
\begin{aligned}
0.41 \pm `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot 0.0698 &= 0.41 \, \pm \, 0.137 \\ &= (0.41 - 0.137, \, 0.41 + 0.137) \\ &= (0.273, \, 0.547).
\end{aligned}
$$

Yohan and Ilyas are 95% "confident" that the true proportion red of the bowl's balls is between 28.3% and 55.7%. Given that the true population proportion $p$ was `r p_red`, in this case they successfully captured the fish.

In Step 4, we defined a statistical quantity known as the *margin of error*.\index{margin of error} You can think of this quantity as how much the net extends to the left and to the right of the center of our net. The `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` multiplier is rooted in the 95% rule of thumb we introduced earlier and the fact that we want the confidence level to be 95%. The value of the margin of error entirely determines the width of the confidence interval. Recall from Subsection \@ref(ci-width) that confidence interval widths are determined by an interplay of the confidence level, the sample size $n$, and the standard error.

Let's revisit the poll of President Obama's approval rating among young Americans aged 18-29 which we introduced in Section \@ref(sampling-case-study). Pollsters found that based on a representative sample of $n$ = `r 1000` young Americans, $\widehat{p}$ = `r p_obama` = `r p_obama*100`% supported President Obama. 

If you look towards the end of the article, it also states: "The poll's margin of error was plus or minus `r moe_obama*100` percentage points." This is precisely the $\text{MoE}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{MoE} &= `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \text{SE} =  `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}} = `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \sqrt{\frac{`r p_obama`(1-`r p_obama`)}{`r 1000`}} \\
&= `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot 0.0108 = `r moe_obama` = `r moe_obama*100`\%
\end{aligned}
$$

Their poll results are based on a confidence level of 95% and the resulting 95% confidence interval for the proportion of all young Americans who support Obama is: 

$$\widehat{p} \pm \text{MoE} = `r p_obama` \pm `r moe_obama` = (`r p_obama - moe_obama`, \, `r p_obama + moe_obama`) = (`r (p_obama - moe_obama)*100`\%, \, `r (p_obama + moe_obama)*100`\%).$$ 

#### Confidence intervals based on `r n_friend_groups` tactile samples {-}

Let's revisit our `r n_friend_groups` friends' samples from the `bowl` from Subsection \@ref(student-shovels). We'll use their `r n_friend_groups` samples to construct `r n_friend_groups` theory-based 95% confidence intervals for $p$. Recall this data was saved in the `tactile_prop_red` data frame included in the `moderndive` package:

1. `rename()` the variable `prop_red` to `p_hat`, the statistical name of the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$.
1. `mutate()` a new variable `n` making explicit the sample size of 50.
1. `mutate()` other new variables computing:
    * The standard error `SE` for $\widehat{p}$ using the previous formula.
    * The margin of error `MoE` by multiplying the `SE` by `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)`
    * The left endpoint of the confidence interval `lower_ci`
    * The right endpoint of the confidence interval `upper_ci`

```{r, message=FALSE}
conf_ints <- tactile_prop_red %>% 
  rename(p_hat = prop_red) %>% 
  mutate(
    n = 50,
    SE = sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n),
    MoE = 1.96 * SE,
    lower_ci = p_hat - MoE,
    upper_ci = p_hat + MoE
  )
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
if (!knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  conf_ints
}
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:tactile-conf-int), let's plot the `r n_friend_groups` confidence intervals for $p$ saved in `conf_ints` along with a vertical line at $p$ = `r p_red` indicating the true proportion of the `bowl`'s balls that are red. Furthermore, let's mark the sample proportions $\widehat{p}$ with dots since they represent the centers of these confidence intervals.

```{r tactile-conf-int, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap= "33 confidence intervals at the 95\\% level based on 33 tactile samples of size $n = 50$.", fig.height=6, purl=FALSE}
conf_ints <- conf_ints %>%
  mutate(
    y = 1:n(),
    p = 900 / 2400,
    captured = lower_ci <= p & p <= upper_ci
  )
groups <- conf_ints$group

ggplot(conf_ints) +
  geom_point(
    aes(
      x = p_hat, y = y,
      alpha = factor(captured, levels = c("TRUE", "FALSE"))
    ),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 900 / 2400, col = "red") +
  geom_segment(aes(
    y = y, yend = y, x = lower_ci, xend = upper_ci,
    alpha = factor(captured, levels = c("TRUE", "FALSE"))
  )) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:33, labels = groups) +
  labs(
    x = expression("Proportion of red balls"), y = "",
    alpha = "Captured"
  ) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()
  )
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This code is used for dynamic non-static in-line text output purposes
n_obs_friend_groups <- conf_ints %>%
  filter(captured == TRUE) %>%
  nrow()
```

Observe that `r n_obs_friend_groups` of the `r n_friend_groups` confidence intervals "captured" the true value of $p$, for a success rate of `r n_obs_friend_groups` / `r n_friend_groups` = `r round(n_obs_friend_groups / n_friend_groups * 100, 2)`%. While this is not quite 95%, recall that we *expect* about 95% of such confidence intervals to capture $p$. The actual observed success rate will vary slightly. 

Theory-based methods like this have largely been used in the past because we didn't have the computing power to perform simulation-based methods such as bootstrapping. They are still commonly used, however, and if the sampling distribution is normally distributed, we have access to an alternative method for constructing confidence intervals as well as performing hypothesis tests as we will see in Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing).

The kind of computer-based statistical inference we've seen so far has a particular name in the field of statistics: *simulation-based inference*. This is because we are performing statistical inference using computer simulations.\index{simulation-based inference} In our opinion, two large benefits of simulation-based methods over theory-based methods are that (1) they are easier for people new to statistical inference to understand and (2) they also work in situations where theory-based methods and mathematical formulas don't exist.

#### Confidence intervals based on 100 virtual samples {-}

Let's say, however, we repeated this 100 times, not tactilely, but virtually. Let's do this only 100 times instead of 1000 like we did before so that the results can fit on the screen. Again, the steps for compute a 95% confidence interval for $p$ are:

1. Collect a sample of size $n = 50$ as we did in Chapter \@ref(sampling)
1. Compute $\widehat{p}$: the sample proportion red of these $n$ = 50 balls
1. Compute the standard error $\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$
1. Compute the margin of error $\text{MoE} = `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \text{SE} =  `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$
1. Compute both end points of the confidence interval:
    + `lower_ci`: $\widehat{p} - \text{MoE} = \widehat{p} - `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \text{SE} = \widehat{p} - `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$
    + `upper_ci`: $\widehat{p} + \text{MoE} = \widehat{p} + `r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \text{SE} = \widehat{p} +`r qnorm(0.975) %>% round(2)` \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$

Run the following three steps, being sure to `View()` the resulting data frame after each step so you can convince yourself of what's going on:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# First: Take 100 virtual samples of n=50 balls
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 100)

# Second: For each virtual sample compute the proportion red
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)

# Third: Compute the 95% confidence interval as before
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_prop_red %>% 
  rename(p_hat = prop_red) %>% 
  mutate(
    n = 50,
    SE = sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n),
    MoE = 1.96 * SE,
    lower_ci = p_hat - MoE,
    upper_ci = p_hat + MoE
  )
```

Here are the results:

```{r virtual-conf-int, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.cap="100 confidence intervals based on 100 virtual samples of size n = 50.", purl=FALSE}
set.seed(79)

virtual_samples <- bowl %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 100)

# Second: For each virtual sample compute the proportion red
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>%
  group_by(replicate) %>%
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>%
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)

# Third: Compute the 95% confidence interval as before
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_prop_red %>%
  rename(p_hat = prop_red) %>%
  mutate(
    n = 50,
    SE = sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n),
    MoE = 1.96 * SE,
    lower_ci = p_hat - MoE,
    upper_ci = p_hat + MoE
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    y = seq_len(n()),
    p = 900 / 2400,
    captured = lower_ci <= p & p <= upper_ci
  )

ggplot(virtual_prop_red) +
  geom_point(aes(x = p_hat, y = y, color = captured)) +
  geom_segment(aes(
    y = y, yend = y, x = lower_ci, xend = upper_ci,
    color = captured
  )) +
  labs(
    x = expression("Proportion red"),
    y = "Replicate ID",
    title = expression(paste("95% confidence intervals for ", p, sep = ""))
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 900 / 2400, color = "red")
```

We see that of our 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size $n$ = 50, `sum(virtual_prop_red[["captured"]])` of them captured the true $p = 900/2400$, whereas `100 - sum(virtual_prop_red[["captured"]])` of them missed. As we create more and more confidence intervals based on more and more samples, about 95% of these intervals will capture. In other words, our procedure is "95% reliable."

### What's to come?

Now that we've equipped ourselves with confidence intervals, in Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing) we'll cover the other common tool for statistical inference: hypothesis testing. Just like confidence intervals, hypothesis tests are used to infer about a population using a sample. However, we'll see that the framework for making such inferences is slightly different.
